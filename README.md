1.) In this tutorial we will see some exaamples of how a support ticket gets created and managed. We will play around with creating tickets as an end user and helpdesk agent, as well as see how these tickets get altered and resolved.

2.) Using a User account from our previous tutorial, we are going to log in from the Support Center home page. Next, select New Ticket from under the ticket tab. Create a ticket using the Business Critical Outage help topic and fill out the Issue Summary with an urgent scenario that you come up with.

3.) Now we are going to log in as an Agent and view the ticket. Right away we can see that there is no SLA nor priority level. By clicking on the respective fields, we can change the SLA to SEV-A and priority to Emergency. An optional text box will appear where you can give a reason for changing both settings.

4.) Scrolling down, we can see another text box where we have the option to post a reply or send a message to the User. We can pretend that the issue was looked into and resolved, and leave a message. Click the ticket status dropdown box and change the status from Open to Resolved.

5.) For our last ticket, log out of your admin account and log back in as an Agent. Make a ticket with Equipment Request as the help topic. Experiment with the SLA and priority as the agent and log back into the administrator account. You can change these settings back as the admin, and post a reply as well. When you are done, you should see that your tickets are no longer in the queue.
